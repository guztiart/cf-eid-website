    masFeatures: {
      excellentVibrationResistance: "1. Excellent vibration resistance and sealing performance",
      excellentVibrationResistanceDescription: "Due to an end-face seal structure consisting of a rubber sealing ring and a stainless steel mating ring, it is able to follow complex shaft vibration and displacements thereby demonstrating an excellent sealing performance.",
      excellentFollowabilityInAxialDirection: "2. Excellent followability in axial direction",
      excellentFollowabilityInAxialDirectionDescription: "As sealing is achieved by seal ring rotating at the same speed as the shaft and its face structure making contact against stationary mating ring as a stopper, it is able to absorb all axial movement.",
